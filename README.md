1.) Summarize the project and what problem it was solving

The project takes in a file input that includes a list of items. These items are food items and many are repeating. The problem was that we needed to figure out the frequency of each item listed. We then needed to create a file from this data that displayed every item in the list and the amount of times its repeated. 

2.) What did you do particularly well?

I believe that the user experience was particularly done well. I believe the program was easy to file and allowed the user to retrieve the information necessary relatively well

3.) Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I believe that I could have used syntax that was much more efficient. I believe because I am new to c++ I wrote code with more lines than necessary. Using more efficient syntax improves readability for other programmers and myself when I come back to review the code. 

4.)Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I didnt particularly find any part of the code to be challenging. In principle I ave done file handling programs before with java and python so my understanding of the necessary functionality was there.It was a matter of looking at the doucmentation in order to figure out the specific syntax necessary to perform such functionality that was the challenge of the code. But I find I do this with every project. Shout outs to google and great documentation lol.

5.)What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I believe the biggest use case for programs on any level is data reception, manipulation and output. So I believe the fundamentals found in this program will transfer very well for me on much larger projects. I have one coming up with a start up team this summer so im excited. 

6.)How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I acheived this by using best practice. Making a class to handle an object that held all my functions. Stated all the variables necessary at the top of the program. And left inline comments on all of my syntax so I know exactly what my intention was when making it.
